Man, I really let myself go. Things ramped up really hard at my last job and I've just been so lost in the sauce. I eventually got laid off about a month ago and I haven't had a chance to really settle myself. Just constant anger and frustration....

STOP GETTING DISTRACTED.

Anyway - a good game I'm thinking of is like DnD lite.. 

Essentially like a Mario Party style game with an AI Dungeon Master and digestible campaigns. You can choose longer campaigns with a human DM and essentially have it be like a virtualized version of DnD.

DM can have Difficulty level (throws out easier, normal, or harder situations for users to get out of) 
DM will be like an AI chat bot with preset scenarios.
Users can choose areas (Worlds) that they traverse to find 

Keep it small and just call it adventure game lite and do research on dnd mechanics. 

PATENT THE CHATBOT.
