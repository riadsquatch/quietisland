# quietisland
repo for me to plan and build a video game <br>

So in talks with FriskyDingo(Caleb from Wy)  and FriskyDong (Sean from OK), we were talking about survival games and I was thinking of a simple quiet game where minutes in the game would pass like minutes in the realworld -

Your character will get hungry (even if offline, which is ok) so your character will have to scavenge. If you don't play for some time, your character will spawn near the beach at 10% and crates of fresh food from a capsized ship will float nearby

There are no true enemies outside toxic fish and scorpion i guess, but it gives the player a chance to relax. You can have planes and boats crash near the island and have survivors join you on the island for a little bit of companionship (up to 10 neighbors)

Very similar to Animal Crossing, but with the gritty element of Cast away

You and other survivors can build a villa and a society and relax peacefully and terraform the island however you choose. You can also choose to be rescued at anytime if you want to start a new island.
